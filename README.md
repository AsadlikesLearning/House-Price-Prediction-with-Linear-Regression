## Overview

This project implements a basic linear regression model to predict house prices. It generates a sample dataset of house sizes and prices, splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a linear regression model, and visualizes the results.

## Features

- Generate sample data for house sizes and prices
- Implement linear regression using scikit-learn
- Visualize the data and regression line using Matplotlib
- Calculate and display model coefficients and performance metrics

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation



2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```
```

This will generate the sample data, train the model, display the plot, and print the model's coefficients and performance metrics.

## Output

The script will produce:

1. A scatter plot showing the actual house prices vs. sizes, along with the regression line.
2. Printed output in the console, including:
   - Model intercept (base price)
   - Model coefficient (price increase per square foot)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared score
